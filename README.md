I was the Backend Developer for this project, and I collaborated with the Product Manager and Frontend Developer to launch the first iteration of the website under a strict time limit.

My main role as the Backend Developer was to create a full LAMP stack so that the website could go live. This LAMP stack used Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, and PHP. I used AWS throughout the whole process, discovering errors and best practices along the way.
